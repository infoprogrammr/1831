<p>Sumit goes out for shopping in a mall to buy some pencils. At the counter , it is written that if the amount is&nbsp; upto 100rs , the rightmost integer gets round off , if it is upto 1000rs , then the rightmost two integers gets rounded off&nbsp; if they are below 50 mark(like 248=200), but if they are greater than 50 mark then it will reduce to 50 mark.(like 863=850) . Now , if shopping is greater than 1000 , then a 10%discount is given(on the original value) and&nbsp; the 2 rightmost integers&nbsp; gets zero (after giving discount)</p>
